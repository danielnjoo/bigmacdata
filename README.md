# Big Mac Dataset

Originally from the Economist, great interactive explanation of which can be found [here](https://www.economist.com/news/2020/07/15/the-big-mac-index). This package makes that data available and recalculates adjusted index figures on different IMF GDP data to increase coverage from 2000-2020 from 2011-2020.
